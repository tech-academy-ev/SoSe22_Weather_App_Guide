## IDE

Now that you know the basics of Web Development you are ready to go and write some code!

But there is still a question left to answer.

Where do programmers write their code. Surely not in a Word document or the default text editor of their operating system. Developers use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to write code because it comes with a lot of handy features that help developers code faster and cleaner.

The most IDEs have a lot of features that you probably wont even need during this course but once you get used to the following advantages you don't want to code without them anymore.

**1. Graphical User Interface**  
The GUI of an IDE has been designed in a way that allows you to see your file directory, editor, terminal and some IDEs even have an interface to download packages and even for version control.

**2. Autocomplete**  
If the IDE knows your programming language it can anticipate what you are going to type next and it will pop up some autocompletion suggestions.

**3. Syntax Highlighting**  
The IDE can also provide some visual aid to your syntax based on your programming language, so that special words have a different color, opening and closing parentheses will have the same color. This may seem distracting at the beginning but once you get used to it, it will help you code faster.

**4. Debugging**  
No one can avoid to write code without bugs. IDEs know that and they are always in search of your mistakes such as typos, syntax errors and even reference errors. The cool thing is that it will show you the error even before you run your code. That way you don't have to wait for your code to run and break.

Some popular IDEs for Web Development are Visual Studio Code, Vim and Sublime Text 3. We recommend you to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as it is also used in the Udemy Course you will be learning with.

For this course and your project you can also use the online code editor [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/). This IDE is based on the same platform as Visual Studio Code, but offers some additional functionalities. You can create teams that can not only access the same files but you can also have a live coding session together in the same file. To sign up you need a free account, which you can create in a matter of seconds.
