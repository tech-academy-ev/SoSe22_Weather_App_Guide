[["index.html", "Weather App Project SoSe22 Chapter 1 Welcome!", " Weather App Project SoSe22 TechAcademy e.V. Summer Term 2022 Chapter 1 Welcome! You’ve just gotten accepted into our web-development program for the summer term of 2022 and want to know what’s it all about actually? Maybe you signed up, because of our awesome marketing’s team TikTok campaign, or you may already have an app idea in your head. Whatever the reason may be, we can assure you of one thing: If you follow through with the semester, you will have gained an awesome skill to have and a solid foundation for further programming adventures. We will help and guide you along the way to the best of our abilities and hope we can share some of that fascination that got us into programming with you! Learning to code is incredibly rewarding but can also be difficult and frustrating. Like any skill worth knowing, it takes time to acquire, and it can’t be learned in a weekend or even a month. With that said, anyone can learn how to program as long as they are willing to put in the time and effort. So before we get into the meat and get our hands dirty, let’s go over how this semester is structured. Over the following months, there will be a total of four Coding Meetups, spaced out evenly where you will have the ability to meet your peers, work together on our application and ask questions to your mentors. But what about the rest of the semester? As mentioned previously any skill takes time. So you will have to do work on your own as well. For self-study purposes this guideline only serves as a rough draft. However, we have partnered up with Udemy and thus you have free access to the ultimate web-development bootcamp course. Everything you will learn there, you can later use within your own project and solidify your knowledge. In your project, you can work in groups of up to four team members. You can choose your teammates independently and we will not interfere with your arrangements. It is however beneficial, that all group members have approximately the same level of knowledge. We explicitly encourage you to collaborate with students from different university faculties. This not only allows you to get to know people from other faculties, but may also give you a whole new perspective on the project and tasks. When submitting your project please note: for a certificate, each person must submit the project individually. However, hand-ins may be similar within your group. You can get more information at our first Coding Meetup on May 18, 2022. Every semester, the Product Development Team at TechAcademy thinks hard about a new project that is suited for you to get into web-development. This semester we decided to let you create a weather-app. You’ve seen them countless times on various websites and may use your favourite one every day to check if you have to put on a raincoat or sunscreen. But how does the data get to the website? How does it update with every refresh and how can one make look that all appealing to an audience? These are all questions that we will tackle in this semester. We hope you are as hyped up about that as we are! The model weather-app that you will see later on in the course and this associated project guide was developed and written entirely from scratch by Sebastian Hönig and Burak Onat from TechAcademy’s Web Development Team.

"],["tools.html", "Chapter 3 Tools 3.1 IDE 3.2 API 3.3 Udemy", " Chapter 3 Tools 3.1 IDE Now that you know the basics of Web Development you are ready to go and write some code! But there is still a question left to answer. Where do programmers write their code. Surely not in a Word document or the default text editor of their operating system. Developers use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to write code because it comes with a lot of handy features that help developers code faster and cleaner. The most IDEs have a lot of features that you probably wont even need during this course but once you get used to the following advantages you don’t want to code without them anymore. 1. Graphical User Interface The GUI of an IDE has been designed in a way that allows you to see your file directory, editor, terminal and some IDEs even have an interface to download packages and even for version control. 2. Autocomplete If the IDE knows your programming language it can anticipate what you are going to type next and it will pop up some autocompletion suggestions. 3. Syntax Highlighting The IDE can also provide some visual aid to your syntax based on your programming language, so that special words have a different color, opening and closing parentheses will have the same color. This may seem distracting at the beginning but once you get used to it, it will help you code faster. 4. Debugging No one can avoid to write code without bugs. IDEs know that and they are always in search of your mistakes such as typos, syntax errors and even reference errors. The cool thing is that it will show you the error even before you run your code. That way you don’t have to wait for your code to run and break. Some popular IDEs for Web Development are Visual Studio Code, Vim and Sublime Text 3. We recommend you to use Visual Studio Code as it is also used in the Udemy Course you will be learning with. For this course and your project you can also use the online code editor CodeSandbox. This IDE is based on the same platform as Visual Studio Code, but offers some additional functionalities. You can create teams that can not only access the same files but you can also have a live coding session together in the same file. To sign up you need a free account, which you can create in a matter of seconds. 3.2 API This semester the web development course will build an interactive weather application but more on the project will come later. For now let’s answer the question: Where does our weather data come from? Obviously we do not keep track of the weather data. There are plenty of APIs that provide such a service. But what exactly is an API? An API (Application Programming Interface) allows programmers to get some data from somewhere else and do whatever you want to do with it. For example you could display such data on your web page. These API services are often expensive but there are some very cool APIs that allow us to do some stuff for free. How do we get the data? Every API works differently but if you understand one API you probably will also understand every other API very easily. We have to write some code that asks the API what data we want? In JavaScript you can use the fetch() function to request data from somewhere. How do we use the data? After you fetched the data from an API you have to change the format of the data into an JavaScript object so that you can work with those information. Some of you might ask in which form the data comes to us and that would be very good question. Most API Services use JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) to send data. You can read more about it in the additional resources part but for now you should know that it is a text-based format for representing structured data based on JavaScript object syntax. It is commonly used for transmitting data in web applications (e.g., sending some data from the server to the client). For your project we recommend you to use the OpenWeather API which has a free tier that you can use after creating a free account. If you read their documentation page you will see many different API options you can choose from. But don’t worry! Once you know how one of them works you will get the hang of it. You can start with the „Current Weather Data API Call“ and inspect the data structure. Note which data you will need and try to extract it from there. You can use a Chrome Extension called JSON Formatter to have a clear look at the data. 3.3 Udemy For this course you will be learning with the The Web Development Bootcamp 2022 on Udemy. Even if you realy want to learn JavaScript very early, we strongly suggest beginners to follow the provided order of the courses as their contents build on each other. You won’t need to watch the whole course to finish the project. Because this will be a simple frontend project and the second part of the Udemy course is all about backend. During the course there are also a lot of sections in which you will build things. You can skip those sections if you like to but if you have the time try them on your own. You learn the most by building stuff and apply what you have learned. In the table below you can find the sections you need to watch to complete your project: Section Name Duration (h) 1.
