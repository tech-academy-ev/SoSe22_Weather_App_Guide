# Project

## Project introduction
As you know by now this semester you will work on a weather app. This chapter will contain many information about the project. You can come back here anytime to watch your progress and also get some ideas how you should start and go on with the features the weather app will have. We have build an example weather app which can serve as an orientation but you can style your app as you wish.

But don't you think an weather app is just a panel that shows us the current weather of a city. You can add a lot of small features that can make a big user experience difference. Some of these features will be mandatory for your project and some of them are just ideas you can incorporate in your app.

| Mandatory Features | Other Feature Ideas |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| Search bar for city| Sidebar with last searched cities |
| Forecast bar for daily weather | Weather for current user location |
|| Toggle functionality for forecast and/or last searches |

## Your assingment(s)
You can use this chapter as a guide to your project. We won't spoil any code for you but instead give you some ideas and hints for the problems that you might have while building the end product.

### Step 1: The Idea {-}
1. Familiarize yourself with the project idea. Search for other weather apps in the web and get a feeling how it should work. Think about what you would do differently or how it could be improved.

2. Make a wireframe sketch to plan your further development. A rough drawing is enough for the moment, but it should already include all the elements and functionality. Make your own sketch first before pooling any ideas with your team and agreeing on a concept.

### Step 2: The Plan {-}
1. Use your plan from Step 1 build the weather app with "hardcoded" city. You can fill in all the gaps with made up information. This step will help you to layout all the information that will later come from the API.

2. Style the elements on your app with some CSS. But don't go into the details for now. You never know what will eventually change and it may cost you too much time.

### Step 3: The Testing {-}
1. Now it is time to get some real data. You can go over [this section][API] again to read about the API you should be using. We recommend you to get familiar with the API in the console before you include into your script file. Note yourself how the information is structured and which information you wish to display on your final project.

### Step 4: The Implementation {-}
1. If you feel ready with the API start to write some code into your script file. But do it in small steps so that you know where the problem is if something goes wrong. Always log to the console to check if everything works as planned. But don't worry if it doesn't work in the beginning. Look in the console for error messages and google them. There is for sure someone that had the same problem and already found an answer online.

### Step 5: The End {-}
1. Go over the project and test everything out. You can give the project to some friend so that they can use it and give you some feedback. If they find some bugs note them and try to fix them. And of course, don't forget to style your project.
